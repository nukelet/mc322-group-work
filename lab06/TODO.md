## Bugs
Nothing (for now...)

## Tasks
- Review the code (some things could use refactoring, I think)
    - Maybe make the whole thing more generic/scalable
    - Make sure it meets all the specifications
- Do some general cleanup, remove commented code and TODOs
- Maybe document the whole thing a little bit
    - Update the UML
    - Write Javadocs (at least for the important functions)
- Maybe add more detailed fields
    - display whether the arrow is equipped or not/if the player has the gold **OK**
    - Maybe also display a message when the player is in a room with stink/breeze **OK**
- **Important**: write the "report" about portions of the code that meet the quality standards (cf. last section in the project instructions)
-
